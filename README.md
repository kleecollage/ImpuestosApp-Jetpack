# Instructions to Install a Kotlin Application from a Remote Repository

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following programs installed:

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: [Download JDK](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- **Gradle**: [Install Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/)
- **Git**: [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- **Android Studio**: [Download Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Steps to Clone the Repository

1. **Open Terminal**
   Open your preferred terminal. On Windows, you can use Git Bash or the Windows terminal. On macOS and Linux, you can use the default terminal.

2. **Clone the Repository**
   Use the following command to clone the remote repository to your local machine. Make sure to replace `REPOSITORY_URL` with the actual URL of the repository.

   ```sh
   git clone REPOSITORY_URL

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**
	Change the directory to the project folder you just cloned:

	```sh
	cd project_name


## Setting Up the Project in Android Studio

    Open Android Studio
    Launch Android Studio from your applications menu or from the terminal.

    Import the Project
        On the Android Studio welcome screen, select "Open an existing Android Studio project".
        Navigate to the project directory you cloned in the previous step and select it.

    Sync Gradle
        Android Studio should automatically start syncing the project. If it doesnâ€™t, you can do it manually by selecting File > Sync Project with Gradle Files.

    Additional Configuration
        Make sure all dependencies are properly configured and that there are no errors in the build.gradle file.
        If necessary, set up emulators or physical devices for testing the application.

## Running the Application

    Select Device
    In the Android Studio toolbar, select the device or emulator on which you want to run the application.

    Build and Run
    Click the Run button (the green triangle icon) or use the shortcut Shift + F10 to build and run the application on the selected device.
